This is a mostly working zsh completion script for the lunar commands lin, lrm
and lvu.

To install, just drop the _lunar file into some directory in your fpath. You
may need to rm your ~/.zcompdump to refresh your cache.

TODO:
  - don't use hardcoded moonbase path
  - completion for the lunar command (yeaah~)
  - probably some bugs..
